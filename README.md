# CookItApp

This repository is broken down into folders for easier navigation of the
project as a whole. The following folders and their purposes are:

1. App - Contains source code for the application.
2. Database - Contains the scripts for the database.
3. Diagrams - Contains system diagrams, use cases, and other assignments from the class.
4. Website - Contains source code for the project website.

### 1. App
My code can be found within this folder, as the main swift files I wrote are
located here. These swift files, along with the storyboard, are what I have
created using xCode and comprise the main logic of the application.
